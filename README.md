# DC Motor Speed Control using ADC and PWM - LPC1768

This project demonstrates how to control the speed of a DC motor using PWM signals generated by the LPC1768 microcontroller. A potentiometer is used as an analog input to vary the speed, which is read using the ADC module.

## Features

- Uses LPC1768 microcontroller
- Reads analog input from potentiometer using ADC (AD1.1)
- Generates PWM signal on pin P1.26 (PWM1.6)
- Controls DC motor speed based on ADC value
- Displays ADC value on LCD

## Components Used

- LPC1768 Development Board
- DC Motor
- L293D Motor Driver
- Potentiometer
- 16x2 LCD
- Power Supply

## Pin Configuration

- **ADC Input:** P0.25 (AD1.1)
- **PWM Output:** P1.26 (PWM1.6)
- **LCD:** Connected to GPIO1

## How it Works

1. The potentiometer voltage is read using ADC.
2. The ADC value is mapped to PWM duty cycle.
3. PWM signal controls the motor speed.
4. The current ADC value is shown on the LCD.
